The link to the Shiny-app: https://tawzoo.shinyapps.io/Shiny-App/

This apps uses the data collected about NFL players throughtout the league from Kaggle which ranges form 1920 to 2016. The data had a lot of missing observations since
there are 17172 observations and 16 variables. The weights are measured in lbs and the height measured in inches. 

The plot page has a graph which plots the height and the average weight of the heights based on the selected positions. "Choose color" changes the color of the plots to the users preference. The options are Pink, Green, Orange, Blue and Gold. "Choose position" selects the position which the user wants to look at height vs. average weight graph. Multiple can be selected at once and the options are the positions that a player can play. The graph also provides the average height and weight of all of the positions selected.

The table page has a table which provides infomation about how many players got drafted in position from selected colleges. it also includes the average height and weight of each positions. The user has options to select colleges where players have been drafted from which includes 20+ colleges. The list has been downsized to include collleges that have at least drafted 20 or more into the NFL from 1920-2016, in order to make it user-friendly. The table also provides the total number of players that were drafted and the average height and weight from them. 

This Ps took me around 7-8 hours to do.
